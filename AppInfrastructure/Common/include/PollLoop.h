/**
 *  @class PollLoop
 *  @brief A wrapper around epoll that allows for adding, modifying & deleting
 *  of source events.
 *
 *  Poll loop sources are a tuple of a shared_ptr<IPollSource>, an fd and a
 *  bitmask of events to listen on.  PollSource objects are store as weak_ptrs
 *  and only locked when they have been triggered and their process() function
 *  is to be called.
 *
 *  This should make the race conditions with calling an object that has been
 *  destroy safe, however it does means that PollSource objects shouldn't
 *  assume that their process() methods won't be called after they've been
 *  removed from the poll loop.
