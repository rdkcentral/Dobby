# Dobby RDK Storage Plugin

## Quick Start
### Loop Mounts
Add the following section to your OCI runtime configuration `config.json` file to create loop mount. It will mount file from "source" field into container
space "destination".

```json
{
    "rdkPlugins": {
        "storage": {
            "required": true,
            "data": {
                "loopback": [
                    {
                        "destination": "/home/private",
                        "flags": 14,
                        "fstype": "ext4",
                        "source": "/tmp/data/data.img"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```
The Storage plugin will only create one loop device for a given source file. If multiple containers share
the same source file, then the Storage plugin will bind mount the same loop device into the different containers.
Thus, they share the same private storage.

### Dynamic Mounts
Add the following section to your OCI runtime configuration `config.json` file to create dynamic mount. 
It will mount "source" into container "destination" only if the source exists on the host.

```json
{
    "rdkPlugins": {
        "storage": {
            "required": true,
            "data": {
                "dynamic": [
                    {
                        "destination": "/tmp/test",
                        "options": [
                            "rbind",
                            "ro",
                            "nodev"
                        ],
                        "source": "/tmp/test"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### Mount tunnel
Storage plugin will create a mount tunnel on devices running older linux kernels.
This will enable dynamic mounting of host devices/directories inside the container on devices running older linux kernels.

You need to have `rootfsPropagation` set to `slave` in the OCI runtime configuration for the tunneling to work.
Some references :
- https://lwn.net/Articles/690679/
- https://brauner.io/2023/02/28/mounting-into-mount-namespaces.html
- https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt

Please note that devices with kernel 5.4 or higher don't need the mount tunnel for dynamic mounts and this code will be disabled at build time.


### Mount Owners
Add the following section to your OCI runtime configuration `config.json` file to configure mount ownership.

```json
{
    "rdkPlugins": {
        "storage": {
            "required": true,
            "data": {
                "mountOwner": [
                    {
                        "source": "/tmp/test",
                        "user": "root",
                        "group": "root",
                        "recursive": false
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you already have other RDK plugins in the bundle, then just add the storage plugin. Do not create multiple `rdkPlugin` sections.

## Options
### Creating loop mounts
For every loop mount point the Storage plugin should create, there should be one item in the array of "loopback". The options inside this object goes as follows:

| Option              | Value                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `destination`       | Directory (inside container space) in which mount should end up                                                                         |
| `source`            | Path to the image file which contains all data (if doesn't exist it will get created)                                                   |
| `flags`             | Mount flags, see linux documentation or "sys/mount.h" for details                                                                       |
|---------------------| ----------------Below this point there are optionals things, with default value in square brackets "[]"---------------------------------|
| `fstype`            | File system type, i.e. "ext4" ["ext4"]                                                                                                  |
| `options`           | Mount options, this corresponds to mount "data" field. []                                                                               |
| `persistent`        | If true image will be persistent between boots, if not image will be deleted after container destruction [true]                         |
| `imgsize`           | Size of the image file (in bytes), only valid if image wasn't there before [12582912] (12 MB)                                           |
| `imgmanagement`     | If `true` the image will be managed by the plugin, meaning it will check for integrity and try and correct any errors found before mounting. On failure, the image will be deleted and re-created [true] |

#### Example
```json
"data": {
    "loopback": [
        {
            "destination": "/home/",
            "flags": 2,
            "fstype": "ext4",
            "source": "/tmp/data/data.img",
            "persistent": false,
            "imgsize": 10485760
        }
    ]
}
```

### Creating dynamic mounts
For every dynamic mount point the Storage plugin should create, there should be one item in the array of "dynamic". The options inside this object goes as follows:

| Option              | Value                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `destination`       | Directory (inside container space) in which mount should end up                                                                         |
| `source`            | Path to the image file which contains all data (if doesn't exist it will get created)                                                   |
| `flags`             | Mount flags, see linux documentation or "sys/mount.h" for details                                                                       |
|---------------------| ----------------Below this point there are optionals things, with default value in square brackets "[]"---------------------------------|
| `options`           | Mount options, this corresponds to mount "data" field. []                                                                               |

#### Example
```json
"data": {
    "dynamic": [
        {
            "destination": "/tmp/test",
            "flags": 2,
            "source": "/tmp/test"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Creating mount owners
For every mount owner configured for the Storage plugin, there should be one item in the array of "mountOwner".
It is important to nite that this changes ownership on the host and "source" path is resolved on the host.

There is precedence for this functionality in the Podman container engine.
See https://github.com/containers/podman/commit/874f2327e6ca963edda7cc46819d51048d3d19a8

The options inside this object goes as follows:

| Option              | Value                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source`            | Directory or file which is the source of the mount, i.e. on host                                                                        |
|---------------------| ----------------Below this point there are optionals things, with default value in square brackets "[]"---------------------------------|
| `user`              | Name of user to change to  (if ommitted, use container default user)                                                                    |
| `group`             | Name of group to change to  (if ommitted, use container default group)                                                                  |
| `recursive`         | Whether to change ownership recursively when source is a directory (if ommitted, treated as false, e.g. non-recursive)                  |

#### Example
```json
"data": {
    "mountOwner": [
        {
            "source": "/tmp/test"
        }
    ]
}
```

This will change ownership to the container default user and group, which will be applied non-recusively.
