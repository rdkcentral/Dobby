/**
 * @brief Dobby RtScheduling plugin.
 *
 *  This plugin sets the RT priority of the container.
 *
 *  This consists of a postInstallation hook that adds the rtpriority
 *  limit and createRuntime hook that calls sched_setscheduler on the
 *  container's init process.
 *
 *  Due to the way scheduling is inherited this will in turn filter down to
 *  all processes running within the container.
