 * @param level The log level to send the message at

 * @param function The name of the function associated with the message
 * @param line The line number associated with the message
 * @param format printf style format string for the message

 * This function generates a message that is sent back to APP_Process for adding
 * to the system DIAG log.
 *
 * These functions will only work when called from inside a container, as they
 * require a pre-created pipe with which to send the messages across.  The
 * file descriptor number of the pipe is automatically set in an environment
 * variable called ETHAN_LOGGING_PIPE.
